# Ngx-restangular

Maintained by [2muchcoffee](https://2muchcoffee.com/).

This project is the follow-up of the [Restangular](https://github.com/mgonto/restangular/). Ngx-restangular is an Angular 2+ service that simplifies common GET, POST, DELETE, and UPDATE requests with a minimum of client code.
It's a perfect fit for any WebApp that consumes data from a RESTful API.

## Demo

Live Demo on Plunkr [Hero App](http://embed.plnkr.co/qozGPV2HowzmtKbC9a54/).
You can also check post about using ngx-restangular with [restdb.io](https://restdb.io/) service in [simple TODO Application](http://blog.2muchcoffee.com/angular_todo_application_with_ng2-restangular_and_restdb-io/)

## Current stage

Ngx-restangular almost all functionality was transferred from the Restangular.
We are open to any cooperation in terms of its further development.

## Renaming project from ng2-restangular to ngx-restangular

This project was renamed from **ng2-restangular** to **ngx-restangular** due to implementation of Semantic Versioning by Angular Core Team. NPM name has also changed, you can install actual version of the project with ``npm install ngx-restangular``.
